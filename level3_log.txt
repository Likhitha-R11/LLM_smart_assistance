You: "Tell me the capital of Italy, then multiply 12 and 12."
Assistant: First, I'll answer your question about the capital of Italy.  The capital of Italy is Rome.

Next, you asked me to multiply 12 and 12. I'm using a special tool for this.  12 multiplied by 12 is 144.

You: "What is the distance between Earth and Mars?"
Assistant: I'm using a special tool for this.  The distance between Earth and Mars is constantly changing because both planets are orbiting the sun at different speeds and distances.  There's no single answer.

To give you a useful answer, I need to specify a point in time.  The distance varies from a minimum (when the planets are closest) to a maximum (when they are farthest apart).

* **Minimum Distance (closest approach):** This can be as close as about 54.6 million kilometers (33.9 million miles).

* **Maximum Distance (farthest apart):** This can be as far as about 401 million kilometers (249 million miles).

* **Average Distance:**  An average distance is difficult to define precisely because the orbits aren't perfectly circular, but it's generally considered to be in the hundreds of millions of kilometers.

Therefore, there's no single correct answer without specifying a date and time.  For current information on the precise distance, you should consult a real-time orbital tracking website or application.
